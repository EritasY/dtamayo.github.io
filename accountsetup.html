                    The initial setup needs to be done physically at the workstation (door code in the discord). Other tutorials will later show you how to log in remotely after this setup. On the login screen, you should see your college username you use for email. If you don't see it, or I've mispelled it, send me an email. Click on it and log in with the password pinned on the discord.
                </p> 
                <p class="lead">
                    When you enter your password, it will tell you to set a new password. It will first ask you for your current password again, and then for a new one. Choose something more secure. Once you're logged in, click on the grid icon on the bottom left of the desktop, and on the search bar, search for 'terminal'. When the icon comes up, click and drag it to the bar along the left side of the desktop. You will use this a ton, so nice to not have to search for it like this every time. The terminal lets you do everything you will need to do. Totally fine if you've never used Linux before, it's a good skill to learn! Take the time to go through Section 2 of the Linux tutorial linked on the resouces page after going through this.

                    When you open a terminal, you should be at your home directory. The path to your home directory will vary depending on the workstation, but should end with a directory named after your username. Try the command
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                    pwd
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p class="lead">
                    this should print, e.g., /mnt/ssd/yourusername. If it doesn't, let me know. Now run (a useful trick is when you start typing .new below, just press tab, and it will autocomplete. This helps avoid typos and lets you know if a file you think should be there is missing, i.e., if pressing tab doesn't autocomplete to anything):
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                    bash -i .newcondaenv.sh 
                    </code>
                </pre>

                    This will create an isolated python installation for you, which has all the packages (rebound spock etc.) installed for you. The installation is called anaconda, and these types of installations are called 'conda environments'. The script above is written to create an environment for you that is also named after your username, e.g., 'idudiak'. Once this finishes, close the terminal window, and open a new one. I've modified your startup scripts so that when you open a new terminal window, it will activate your environment (now that it's installed!). If this worked correctly, your command line should have your username in parentheses in front, e.g.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                    (esundheim) $
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p class="lead">
                    If you don't see your username in parentheses, or if the script run above gives errors, please let me know, as that definitely means there is an issue I have to fix. Try opening python by entering the command
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                    python
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p class="lead">
                    You should get a python command line starting with &gt&gt&gt&gt. Try
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                    &gt&gt&gt&gt import spock
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p class="lead">
                    You might get a warning, but you shouldn't get any errors when that runs. If you get an error, let me know. Press Ctrl + D to quit python. Now run
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                    jupyter notebook
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p class="lead">
                    This should automatically launch a jupyter notebook in firefox. You should be able to create a new Python 3 notebook on the top right, and import rebound, reboundx, and spock without any problems.

If you run into problems, please send me an email with what you did and the errors you got, and I'll help you debug them.
