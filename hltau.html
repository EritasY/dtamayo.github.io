					<p>The concentric gaps in this image of the disk surrounding the young star HL Tau
					may be the most direct evidence we have of
					 forming planets.  It was taken with the new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
					 Array (ALMA) in Chile.  This revolutionary array spaces out dozens of radio dishes
					 to provide the equivalent resolution of a single dish the size of Manhattan. 
					</p>
					<p>
					For the first time, in October 2014, the ALMA team tested the array in its
					maximally extended (highest resolution) configuration.  They then publicly 
					released the resulting "calibration image", showing spectacular gaps and blowing
					<a href="http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/741/1/3/Full/apj401809f1_lr.jpg">previous attempts</a>
					out of the water.  
					</p>
					<p>
					<img src="pix/ALMA.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px"; />
					This is not how science usually runs its course.  Typically, observations are taken,
					analyzed, and then disseminated to the community through scientific talks and 
					peer-reviewed journal articles.  The image's surprise, dearth of details, and deep 
					implications therefore sparked unusual interest and debate in the astronomical
					community.

						<h1>The case for planets</h1>
					</header>
					
					<p>
					While it's extremely challenging to image forming planets directly with current 
					technology, there are several things we know.  First, we observe large disks around
					young stars, and we know that planets form from them.  Second, efforts to discover
					older planets outside our Solar System have revealed that most star systems indeed
					 grow planets. Finally, we know that planets roughly the size of Saturn or larger should
					be massive enough to carve a gap in the disk of gas and dust out of which they grow
					(though there is some debate over exactly how massive a planet has to be to do this).
					</p>
					
					<p> 
					The upshot is that planets are an inherently <i>plausible</i> explanation for the gaps.
					It does not mean that planets are the right answer.  Other scientists are working hard
					on alternate explanations involving fluid dynamics and the interaction of charged
					gas particles with the star's active magnetic field.  But we've been expecting
					to find forming planets once we developed the right eyes, and perhaps finally we have.
					</p>

						<h1>Where do I come in?</h1>
					</header>
					<p>
					I did not take this image.  I mostly study orbital dynamics, and as a general rule
					you do not want me near billion-dollar facilities.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					<img src="pix/solarsystem.jpg" alt="" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px"; />
					I actually came to this project thinking I could prove the gaps <i>weren't</i> carved by planets.
					The fact is that those gaps are absurdly close to one another.  For context, the giant planets 
					in our solar system (the ones that would potentially have carved gaps) are well spaced.  The orbits of
					Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus double in size from one to the next (it is surprisingly hard
					to find a correctly scaled image of the solar system.  Ironically, I found this one at the 
					<a href="http://strdu.com/astrology/">Department of Bucksfanian Astrology</a>).	You can see that the
					outer three gaps in the HL Tau disk are much closer together.

					Here is a simulation where I put Saturn-mass planets in the gaps, including their interaction with
					the gas disk.  Even though the system is "young" (less than 1 million years old), I've sped things up
					and displayed the planets' orbits.  The planets are so close to one another that their mutual gravity 
					violently rearranges their orbits.  Toward the end of the simulation, I slow things down to show 
					the innermost planet getting ejected from the system.  Clearly this does not work.
